## AI Capabilities

### What the AI Does Well

✅ **Excellent at:**
- Identifying furniture types (chairs, tables, cabinets, etc.)
- Recognizing common styles (mid-century, rustic, industrial)

### Pricing Intelligence

The AI suggests prices based on:

3. **Materials**: Quality materials increase value
4. **Condition**: Better condition = higher price

- Rarity of the piece
- Your target customer base

## Tips for Best Results

### Photography Tips

- Neutral background colors work best
- Remove other furniture from frame
- Show the piece fully assembled
- Include close-ups of special features

### Getting Better AI Results
